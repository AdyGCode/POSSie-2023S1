## Got Questions?
Part of the ScreenCraft Help Desk is a Knowledge Base (also known as Frequently Asked Questions).
We are slowly adding to this, and have recently added a few more pages to help resolve problems you may be having.

The Knowledge Base is found at: 
- [ScreenCraft Knowledge Base](https://help.screencraft.net.au/hc/1990208628)<br>(https://help.screencraft.net.au/hc/1990208628)

Here are some examples of the articles (or FAQs) that are available so far:
